![](https://i.gyazo.com/adcc4675cd466195adf727ba8a32b544.gif)

## Getting started

If you haven't done it already, checkout the [hands-on Learn Apollo tutorial](https://learnapollo.com/).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/learnapollo/pokedex-react-native-exponent.git
cd pokedex-react-native-exponent
cd exercise-01
yarn install
```

Then start the app in your Exponent Development Environment.

## Workflow

As you're following along the Learn Apollo tutorial, you will work on different coding exercises.
Each exercise has a folder that you can use to start working and a solution folder where you can take a
peek if the instructions given on Learn Apollo are not clear enough.

After you completed the step, you can compare your results to the official solution by looking into the respective
folder. If you found a different solution than we're proposing, feel free to [tell us](http://slack.graph.cool/)
about your solution. ðŸ’¡
